##1. Fix this controller!
Your friend at Gnikiv Code School is having a lot of trouble with their `vegetables_controller.rb` file. Something goes wrong with almost every action! Hunt down the bugs, squash them, and write your friend a `#comment` about each one to explain what was wrong and what change you made.

##2. No RESTful routes for the weary.
Complete [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nKfg82bdNTll2vbqIsj_eqqHw4jsCF5cfiQhvQS8Bm8/viewform?usp=send_form) with 12 questions about last week's material, plus 2 bonus questions.

**Good luck!**
